NCLua TODO -- Tasks that need implementing.                    -*-outline-*-

* KNOWN BUGS

  + nclua/event/tcp_socket.c: Pending operations on disconnect_finished().

    The disconnect_finished() function should cancel pending send or receive
    operations.  Otherwise, the 'disconnect' event will cause these
    operations to fail with 'Socket closed' error.  Currently, to avoid
    reporting such errors, we check if the socket is connected before
    dispatching errors.

* FEATURES OR PROBLEMS

  + lib/ncluaw.c: Check event syntax in ncluaw_send().

    The ncluaw_send() function should check the syntax of its event
    parameter.

  + src/nclua.c: Add extra options to the nclua standalone interpreter.

    Some useful options:
      --debug       print debugging information
      --load=FILE   load FILE before running the given script
      --plugin=FILE load and registers FILE as a new event plugin

    If no input file is given, nclua should read input from stdin.

  + src/nclua.c: Add some widgets to the player window.

    It would be useful to have a menu bar and status bar.  The latter, for
    example, could show the current frame-rate.  These could be enable or
    disabled via option flags.

  + src/nclua.c: Add support to configuration options.

    These could be given via command-line options, environment variables, or
    a configuration file (e.g., ~/.nclua).

  + tests/server.pl: Add HTTP support.

    Currently, the server understands no application protocol.  If we add
    basic HTTP support to it, e.g., via an --http flag, we could remove the
    requirement of an Internet connection from the HTTP tests, viz., http
    event class and http_sock stuff.

  + Generate API documentation.

  + List the problems with the ABNT or ITU-T standards.

    E.g., the standard establishes that the size canvas:attrFont() is given
    in pixels.  This is probably wrong; most APIs support only point values.
    We're thus assuming that font size is given in points.

* OPTIMIZATION AND CLEAN UP

  + nclua/event/tcp_socket.c: Use luaL_Buffer to reduce string copies.

    Cf. nclua/event/http_soup.c.

  + src/nclua.c: Improve GTK to NCLua key event mapping.

  + build-aux/syntax-check-copyright: Make it project agnostic.

    This way we can use it in other projects (cf. syntax-check).
